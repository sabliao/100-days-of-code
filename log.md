# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100 Days of Code repo and decided to start w/ project that would help me organize Thanksgiving backpacking trip pictures by date/time taken (since timestamp modified field on some pics were simply the timestamp the pics were uploaded, but at least the data is embedded in the filename).

**Thoughts**: I do want to continue w/ FreeCodeCamp, but the 'rules' for this challenge require not simply following tutorials.

**Link(s) to work**: [Fix Pic Timestamp](https://github.com/sabliao/fix-pic-timestamp)
